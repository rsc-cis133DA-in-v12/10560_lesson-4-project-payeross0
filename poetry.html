        <h2>A Red, Red Rose</h2>
        <p>
            By Robert Burns
        </p>
        <p>
            O my Luve is like a red, red rose
                That’s newly sprung in June;
            O my Luve is like the melody
                That’s sweetly played in tune.
        </p>
        <p>
            So fair art thou, my bonnie lass,
                So deep in luve am I;
            And I will luve thee still, my dear,
                Till a’ the seas gang dry.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Till a’ the seas gang dry, my dear,
                And the rocks melt wi’ the sun;
            I will love thee still, my dear,
                While the sands o’ life shall run.</em>
        </p>
        <!-- This is an important stanza to me because it symbolizes how long a love can last for someone that is truly important. -->
        <p>
            And fare thee weel, my only luve!
                And fare thee weel awhile!
            And I will come again, my luve,
                Though it were ten thousand mile.
        </p>
